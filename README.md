# dashboard-odin-project

This is a simple dashboard created using HTML and CSS.  Specifically I encorprated CSS Grid and Flexbox.

What I learned creating this project:

1.  to use CSS Grid and Flexbox together effectively

2.  to create a more dynamic website

3.  althougth I am still in the process of learning how to make my projects look good on mobile, I am pleased with how this one turned out


What I am excited to learn more about:

1. I will be diving further into Java Script and getting into the intermediate level.

2. I will also be learning more about databases and how to incorporate that into my builds.
