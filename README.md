# dashboard-odin-project

This is the second project as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) in the [Intermediate HTML and CSS Section](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css).  This is a simple dashboard created using HTML and CSS.  Specifically I encorprated CSS Grid and Flexbox.

### What I learned creating this project: ###

1.  How to use CSS Grid and Flexbox together effectively.

2.  How to create a more dynamic website.

3.  Incorporating minmax, autofit, and autfill for more flexability.

### What I am excited to learn more about: ###

1. I will be diving further into JavaScript and moving to the intermediate level.

2. I will also be learning more about databases and how to incorporate that into my builds.
